# How to do a github

### Cloning
1. Download git from [here](https://git-scm.com/download "Git Download").
2. In your terminal/cmd, use `cd` to navigate to where you want to clone the directory.
3. Run the command `git clone https://github.com/fCherkasskiy/Karels-Adventure.git`. This will create a directory named after the repo where you currently are in the terminal.
4. Assuming everything worked, you should now have the repository cloned and working.
